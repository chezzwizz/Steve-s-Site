		<h1>Visual Basic .Net Custom Types</h1>
		
		<H2>Classes</H1>
		<p>In the OOP paradigm, classes are used to define object constructs that have
		associated methods and properties which are used by the programmer to
		interact with an instansiated class in the program.</p>
		<p>In Visual Basic, the class constuct is similar to other OOP languages in
		how it is defined. The <code>Class</code> keyword is used to declare a custom
		object template type. To declare a class within a given <em>decleration space
		</em>, one would type the following:
		</p>
		<code class="block"><pre>
			Class C
				' Class properties and methods are defined in this space known as the
				' decleration space.
			End Class
		</pre></code>

		<h2>Concepts</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>fully qualified name</strong>: The identifier of an object to
			include the decleration context identifiers.</li>
			<li><strong>type signature</strong>: The fully qualified identifier (name)
			of a type with modifiers and parameter declerations.</li>
			<li><strong>decleration space</strong>: The range of context associated with
			a set of definitions and declerations.</li>
			<li><strong>decleration context</strong>: The "parent" or containing
			decleration space in  which other decleration spaces are created.</li>
			<li><strong>decleration</strong>: The point in the program at which the
			unique signature is specified, but not necessarily associate with a value.
			In Visual Basic, the <code>Dim</code> (Declare In Memory) keyword is used
			to specify a decleration. This operation creates a "blank" area in memory
			that is the size of the specified type based on the <em>type signature</em>
			of an object.</li>
			<li><strong>definition</strong>: The point at which a declared object is
			assigned a value. When a variable is defined, the memory that was
			<em>declared</em> previously gets modified to represent the data which
			conforms to the constraints of the specified <em>signature</em>.</li>
