# Cash Money Knowledge
A new branch created by a request from a guy named Steve and now a potential for a professional trade. This knowledge base is an attempt to provide a way to communicate back what I learn as I learn it in a readable format that can be edited and consumed by contributors.

The idea is that there is a professional "sub" economy in the trade of information amongst peers and this, being an experiment as it were, is something I hope former alumni and students alike will participate in and read.

The information is aimed to be as acurate as possible, and modifications should be made by branching into a personal repository, making edits and changes, and then requesting that the orignial source "pull" from your modifications. Spreading the word about your personal repository amongst peers will enable a hirearchal contribution to a knowledge base that each person can contribute to and correct over time.

Thanks K!
